ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Stephen Chen, hailing from Shenzhen, China. Currently pursuing my studies in Computer Science at UCL, I have a keen interest in researching areas such as Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. Beyond academics, I am also an enthusiast in photography and gastronomy. I enjoy exploring different locales, capturing scenic moments, and savoring diverse cuisines.
